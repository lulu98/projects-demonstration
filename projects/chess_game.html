     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>A chess game that you can play with another person. The game was built simply by positioning the chess pieces on the chess board through a simple python graphics library. Furthermore, the player has the option to use the buttons to move a certain chess piece or by moving the chess pieces with the mouse. Both players have a certain time limit. Furthermore, it is possible to step back in time to rethink a certain move.</p>
