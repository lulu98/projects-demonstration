     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>In this game, you have to steer a rocket from a launching pad all the way to a landing pad safely. You will encounter enemies and have to avoid obstacles along the way. The game was built in Unity with C#. Furthermore the logic of an enemy is implemented that will follow your every move with a simple distance formula. If you hit the enemy with a bullet, the enemy duplicates and you have to avoid both of them. Furthermore, you can collect coins along the way and you can use a boost to fly faster.</p>
