     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>This mobile app provides the basic functionality of a calculator. You can construct equations with operators +,-,*,/,^ as well as use brackets for more sophisticated calculations. The logic behind the evaluation of the entered mathematical expression is similar to the project <a href="voice_controlled_calculator.html">'Voice-Controlled Calculator'</a>. The entered mathematical expression will be in infix notation, but must be translated into postfix notation for the computer to work on it. Afterwards the evaluation of the postfix expression ist quite straight forward.</p>
