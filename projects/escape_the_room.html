     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>In this game, the player has to find a way out of the building by solving a riddle. Most of the motion in the scene is implemented by Blueprints, like the door swing. Object interaction as well as an object alignment function was implemented. The game was built in Unreal Engine 4 (UE4) and C++.</p>
