     <h3>Description</h3>
     <p>A web application featuring Pong. The player can decide if he either wants to play against another person or against the computer. The ball is simulated with a simple formula that translates the incidence angle into the emergent angle when hitting the walls. The computer is implemented by predicting the future position of the ball and moving towards this destination.</p>
